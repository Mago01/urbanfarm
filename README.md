# Urbanfarm

* Urbanfarm was created in order to reduce waste of fruits/vegetables/herbs that are grown in people's own gardens.
* Users are able to login or register (backend validations were done).
* Users are able to sell or buy in the application. There is a user dashboard as well as individual pages for each item being sold(dashboard does not include users own products being sold).
* Key features include pagination and user image uploads.
